To run the bot you have to rename baseconfig.pl to config.pl and edit it:

server   :  The Jabberserver to which the bot should connect.
username :  The Username the bot should use on the jabber server.
password :  The Password the bot should use for username@server
			(normally if the login fails, the bot should try
			 to register this username, but it's not tested)
owner    :  The owner of the bot (your JID) e.g. yourname@yourserver.com
			(the pls commands only works for the owner)
